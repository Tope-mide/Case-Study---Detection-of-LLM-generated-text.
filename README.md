# 1. Case-Study---Detection-of-LLM-generated-text.

Scenario: I have been hired as a data analyst to work on a machine learning project. The domain I would be working in is the "Detection of LLM generated text". As part of the analysis, I have been asked to propose a methodology suitable for tackling this problem.

A report should be prepared that presents assumptions, proposed approach and rationale with respect to the following aspects:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis / Data Cleaning 
2. Dimensionality Reduction / Feature Selection 
3. Feature Engineering / Feature Extraction 
4. Choice of modelling techniques
5. Hyperparameter Optimisation 
6. Model Evaluation 
7. Scalability Issues
8. Ethical implications
